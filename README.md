# Promptopia

Embark on a journey into creativity with my latest projectâ€”an innovative Dynamic Prompt Sharing App. This web application represents the convergence of modern web development technologies, seamlessly blending the power of React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and NextAuth. The intricate authentication system is fortified with both GitHub OAuth and credential-based authentication, creating a secure and inclusive environment for users to engage. Inspiration drawn from the JS Mastery tutorial not only provided a roadmap but also fostered a deeper understanding of best practices and optimal workflows
